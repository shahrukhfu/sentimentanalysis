# Sentiment Analysis Toolkit ðŸš€

A Python-based solution for classifying tweet sentiments using **Naive Bayes (NBC)**, improved NBC with feature selection (iNBC), and preprocessing pipelines. Perfect for learning NLP fundamentals or deploying lightweight sentiment analysis.


Why This Project?
Airline companies receive thousands of tweets and reviews daily. This tool helps analyze customer sentiment by:

- Analyzing text (tweets, reviews, surveys)
- Classifying sentiment (Positive/Neutral/Negative)
- Visualizing results for easy interpretation
- Offering two models: Fast Naive Bayes and high-accuracy RoBERTa

Built for customer service teams, social media managers, or anyone analyzing public opinion about airlines.
